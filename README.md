# Inert Static Site Generator
Inert is a static site generator for the modern web

> Inert 2 is currently still in alpha. To use Inert 1, please install [`inert-cli`](https://npmjs.com/package/inert-cli)

## Installation
> If you have used Inert 1 on your machine in the past, you will need to uninstall it (`npm rm -g inert-cli`).

Via NPM:
```bash
npm i -g inert-ssg
```

Via Yarn:
```bash
yarn global add inert-ssg
```

## API Documentation
During the alpha period, no API documentation will be released, as the API of these early releases is too volatile. First API documentation will be written when Inert 2 goes into the beta period.
